In this case study, I analysed bike trip data to help a bike-share company, Cyclistic, understand **how casual riders and annual members use its bikes differently**. From these insights, the company aims to maximise the number of annual memberships by designing a new marketing strategy to **convert casual riders into annual members**. Analysis tool used for this project is **SQL**. Visualisation is performed using **Tableau**.\n\n### About the Company\n\n\nIn 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.\n\nUntil now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. **Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members**.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Ask - Define the Business Problem","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Business Tasks\n\nAnalyse bike trip data to gain insights on how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

Monthly data are stored in separate CSV files. This project will use the latest one year data from October 2021 to September 2022. The selected dataset contains 13 fields including:\n- ride_id: unique ride ID for each trip\n- rideable_type: type of bicycle\n- started_at: datetime of trip start\n- ended_at: datetime of trip end \n- start_station_name: station name of start\n- start_station_id: station id of start\n- end_station_name: station name of end\n- end_station_id: station id of end\n- start_lat: latitude coordinate of start\n- start_lng: longitude coordinate of start\n- end_lat: latitude coordinate of end\n- end_lng: longitude coordinate of end\n- member_type: annual member or casual rider\n\n### Credibility and Limitations of Dataset\n\n1. Data is original as it is first party data collected by the bike-share company from its users.\n2. Data is relevant to the business objective.\n3. Data is current and up-to-date.\n4. Due to data-privacy issues, there is no riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that we are not able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.\n\n### Data Selection\n\nThe selected data are stored in total 12 csv files, each containing monthly trip data from Oct 2021 to Sept 2022.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Process - Clean and Manipulate Data ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The source data files are imported into MySQL for cleaning, transformation and manipulation. <br>\n [The full documentation of all queries in this section can be viewd here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D0mEx8UXrf7hBsjZDOuqPE_Xdt5EF8fCMNjWYLQEf9k/edit?usp=sharing)    ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Summary of Steps**\n1.

Annual members take up higher percentage of the total number of rides, but casual riders contributed higher total ride length in minutes.\n2. Distribution of ride length in minutes of both annual members and casual riders are positively skewed.\n3. Annual members do not use docked bikes. Casual members use docked bikes for longer duration trips.\n4. Annual members take more rides on weekdays than weekends, while casual riders take more rides on weekends than weekdays. Ride length in minutes for annual members does not vary a lot, while for casual riders it is higher in weekends.\n5. Over the hours of day, annual members have 2 peaks of ride rount at 8am and 5pm respectively, which suggest a daily commute pattern or regular routines of going to and coming back from school. For casual riders, the peak is at 5pm.\n6. Over the months of year, both annual members and casual riders take the most of rides from June to August and the least of rides from December to February. This distributino over seasonality is most likely associated with local weather.\n7. The overall top 10 popular routes by ride count for casual riders are all near coastal regions, suggesting touristic or leisure purpose of bike usage. While for annual members, the top 10 popular routes are in the city areas with start/end station close to underground stations and the University of Chicago.\n\n### Summary of Difference between Annual Members and Casual Riders <br>\n**Annual members** take more rides on **weekdays** with constantly **shorter ride length** of around 10 minutes. Ride purpose is mostly **daily commute** to workplace or school as the peak hours for rides occur at **8am and 5pm**, and the most frequent routes taken are in the **city areas** near underground stations and University.\n\n**Casual riders** take more rides on **weekends** and **longer ride length** of about 17 minutes. Ride purpose is mostly **leisure purpose** as the most requent ride areas are along the **coastlines**.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Act - Propose Business Recommendations from Analysis","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now we look back to our business questions and make recommendations based on analysis results.\n\n**Diversifiying Annual Membership Package**\n1. Provide special membership plans to attract casual riders via:\n    - Discount on long rides.\n    - Discount on rides during off-peak hours such as overnight cycling.\n\n**Marketing Campaigns and Events**\n1. Promote the annual membership package targeting casual riders in the best scenarios to aim for higher conversion rate.\n    - Location: Along the top most frequent routes taken by casual riders\n    - Season: Summer time (June to August)\n    - Time: Weekends afternoon from 12pm to 8pm\n2. Tap on the leisure nature of casual riders.\n    - Organise monthly cycling event to turn casual riders into regular riders by building up a cycling habbit and routine.\n    - Form a user community with leisure cycling as a form of socialisation through feature in the Cyclistic APP.\n3. Make use of digital media.\n    - Collaborate with online influencers to promote leisure cycling in the form of vlogs.\n    - Tap on social media network to spread marketing news and events by giving out incentives like free one-month membership or organising lucky draws for reposting.\n\n**Additional Information**\n1. If user demographic data can be made available, the analysis can be broken down into finer dimensions. Different marketing strategy can be crafted for different user profiles grouped by gender, age, occupation and so on. The use of social media platform also helps building user profiles.\n2. User survey can be conducted via social media or in-app to collect feedback from users, so as to better understand their needs and satisfaction level.","metadata":{}}]}
