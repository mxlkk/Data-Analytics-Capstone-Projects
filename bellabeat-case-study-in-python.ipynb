In this case study, I carried out Exploratory Data Analysis on smart device usage data to discover trends, gain insights on user profiles and behaviours, and make recommendations to help guide marketing strategy of a tech-driven wellness company - Bellabeat. My analysis followed the 6 steps of data analysis: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share and Act. Analysis tool used for this case study is Python.\n\n### About the Company\n\n\nBellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products for women. The cofounder and Chief Creative Officer, Urška Sršen, believes that analysing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunites for the company.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Ask - Define the Business Problem","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Business Tasks\n\nAnalyse smart device usage data to gain insights on how consumers are using the smart device, discover trends and insights to apply to Bellabeat products.\n\n### Stakeholders\n\n1.

The dataset is generated by respondents from a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 12 March 2016 to 12 May 2016.\n\n### Credibility and Limitations of Dataset\n\n1. Data on fitbit fitness tracker users is relevant to Bellabeat's business problem. \n3. There could be sampling bias in the dataset which makes it not representative of the entire population.\n4. The data is lack of demographic profile information like age, occupation, location, and gender especially. Analysis based on data collected from unknown genders could lead to conclusions not applicable to Bellabeat products since they are only targeting female users. \n5. The data is collected in the year of 2016. Even though it is not more than 10 years ago, it is still quite outdated as users' daily activity and fitness habits could have changed especially after entering the COVID Era. For this reason, this analysis might not apply to markets where strict COVID regulations are continuously imposed on people's daily activity.\n6. The data is not original as it is third party information.\n\n### Data Selection\n\nThe data are stored in total 18 csv files, of which the following files are selected for analysis.\n\n*dailyAcrivity_merged.csv* <br>\n*sleepDay_merged.csv* <br>\n*weightLogInfo_merged* <br>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Process - Clean and Transform Data ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Set Up Environment for Python and Import Data Files\n\nImport numpy, pandas, matplotlib, datetime packages for data processing and visualisation.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nimport datetime as dt\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\npd.set_option('display.float_format', lambda x: '%.1f' % x)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-11-04T08:52:31.704540Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-11-04T08:52:31.704964Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-11-04T08:52:31.712927Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-11-04T08:52:31.704930Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-11-04T08:52:31.711011Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load the interested data files and assign them to new variable names.\ndaily_activity = pd.read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv\")\nsleep_day = pd.read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/sleepDay_merged.csv\")\nweight_log_info = pd.read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/weightLogInfo_merged.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-11-04T08:52:31.715891Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-11-04T08:52:31.716766Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-11-04T08:52:31.757523Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-11-04T08:52:31.716713Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-11-04T08:52:31.756454Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data Observation <br>\nTake a look at the first 5 rows of these dataset to get familiar with the information contained like data attributes and data types.
